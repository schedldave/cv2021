# Animated Faces from Still Images

The goal of this project is to animate the faces of people in still photos. 
Your algorithm should produce a realistic depiction of how a person from a photo could have moved and looked if they were captured in a short video clip. 
There might be several possible algorithms to tackle the project. Nevertheless, I believe that only a deep learning method will produce convincing results.

| Still Image                                             |  Face Animation |
| :---:                                                   |   :---: |

### Variations: 
Don't apply this technique to humans but to other moving objects. For example, trees that move in the wind, or animals such as cats and dogs. Note, however, that it might be hard to find useful training data for other objects.
